# tic-tac-toe
This was a difficult project to make.
In this project I used factories and modules instead of constructors and classes. 
Definitely, there are some pros and cons to both class/constructor and factory/module based object creation and inheritance.
But modules and factories proved to be much more flexible, dynamic, and secure way of creating objects and 
functionaly as modules and factories have the ability to isolate functions not to be used in the global scope
thus promoting privacy of functions and objects. I like that, because when your project becomes larger and messier it helps keep 
things more comprehensible and manageable and prevents naming collisions.
